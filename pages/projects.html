    <h2> Projects worked on </h2>
 	  <p> I have worked mostly on projects involving computational programming. Projects related to programming:</p>
 	  <ul>
   	  <li> I worked on a project dynamically optimizing decisions for an energy grid to incorporate intermittent renewable energy (wind) into the grid </li>
   	  <li>  I worked on comparing the energy and cost benefits of two different types of carbon capture systems (cryogenic and amine-solvent). The project involved dynamic optimization of a complex model. </li>
   	  <li>  Currently I work on a project seeking to unify the advantages and mitigate the disadvantages of different types of non-linear solvers </li>
   	  <li>  No web programming experience... </li>
 	  </ul>
