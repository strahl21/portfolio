	 <h2> Projects worked on </h2>
	 <p> I have worked mostly on projects involving computational programming. These projects are the following: </p>
	 <ul>
	 <li> I worked on dynamic optimization of an energy grid to provide power to all people economically. The key focus of this project was integrating renewable resources into the grid in a way that prevented energy loss. </li>
	 <li>  I worked on comparing the energy and cost benefits of two different types of carbon capture systems (cryogenic and amine-solvent). The project involved dynamic optimization of a complex model. </li>
	 <li>  Currently I work on a project seeking to unify the advantages and mitigate the disadvantages of different types of large scale non-linear solvers </li> 
	 <li>  No web programming experience... </li>
	 </ul>

	 <h2> Work Experience </h2>
	 <p> Summer 2016 I worked as an Intern for a small startup company called Underwater Audio. I worked in R&D developing a new process to waterproof electronics. </p>
	 <p> Summer 2017 I worked as an Intern for HP doing R&D of microfluidic arhcitecture for thermal inkjet. </p>
	 <p> At school I have been a research assistant working on dynamic optimization of carbon capture systems, grid energy optimization, and nonlinear solver development. I am also a TA for a graduate level optimization course </p>
